Dekaf is a feature-rich open-source UI for [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), licensed under [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE.md).

Long story short, initially Dekaf was developed as proprietary software, but after 2+ years of development I didn't found a good way to monetize it.
Some time ago I switched to another project and decided to make Dekaf open source so that it could be useful to someone else.

## Features

- Browse Pulsar resources like tenants, namespaces, topics, subscriptions, consumers and producers.
- View stats for each resource.
- Create topics, edit namespaces policies, split bundles, etc.
- View messages in a topic or multiple topics at once. Filter messages, colorize them. Save and reuse browse sessions.

## Maintenance policy

- Reported critical bugs (if any) will be closed in a short time after the open-source release.
- The codebase has some dead code and requires a little cleanup, but it's not in priority at this moment.
- New features will be added if some company decide to sponsor the project.
- PRs are welcome!
- Tell me if you need a desktop version for MacOS and Linux. The Electron app is ready, and if there is any significant demand, I'll release it.
