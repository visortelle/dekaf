# Dekaf

</p>

**Dekaf** is a feature-rich open-source UI for [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), licensed under [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE.md).

Long story short, initially Dekaf was developed as proprietary software, but after 2+ years of development I didn't found a good way to monetize it.
Some time ago I switched to another project and decided to make Dekaf open source so that it could be useful for others.
If the ASF would like accept this project, I'm ready donate it.

## Features

- Browse Pulsar resources like tenants, namespaces, topics, subscriptions, consumers and producers.
- View stats for each resource.
- Create topics, edit namespace and topic policies, split bundles, etc.
- View messages in a topic or multiple topics at once. Filter messages, colorize them. Save and reuse browse sessions.

There are missing features like multi-user support or message replay. See the [Maintenance policy](#Maintenance-policy) section for details.

## Quick-start

- Please make sure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- Open your terminal
- Create a new directory: `mkdir dekaf && cd ./dekaf`
- Download the `docker-compose.yaml` file and start it:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tealtools/dekaf/main/docker-compose.yaml
```

- Run `docker compose up`
- Wait a few seconds until Pulsar and Dekaf are ready
- Open <http://localhost:8090>
- Enjoy ‚òïÔ∏è

### Demo application

 We also run a demo application that produces data for two new tenants in this quick start.

If you don't see the `demo-schema-types` and `demo-shop` tenants in the tenant list, try to wait for a few seconds and reload the page.

If you want to disable the demo application, remove it from the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Troubleshooting

- If the `pulsar` container cannot start, we recommend ensuring that you have **6GB** or more Docker memory limit. We'll adjust the `docker-compose` memory for a lower limit later.
- In case, you observe bookie-related errors from the `pulsar` container, the simplest way to fix it is to remove the corresponding Docker volume. In case you need the volume data, make a backup first. Otherwise follow these steps:
   - Stop containers by running `docker compose down`
   - Run `docker volume ls | grep pulsar-data` to find the proper `<volume_name>`
   - Run `docker volume rm <volume_name>` to delete the volume
   - Restart containers by running `docker-compose up`

## Maintenance policy

- Reported critical bugs are planned to be fixed in a short time after the open-source release.
- The codebase has some dead code and requires a little cleanup, but it's not in priority at this moment.
- Small features may be added in my spare time. If some company decide to sponsor complex features, it would be an ideal scenario.
- PRs are welcome! See the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Tell me if you need a desktop version for MacOS and Linux. The Electron app is ready, and if there is any visible demand, I'll release it.

Thank you.
