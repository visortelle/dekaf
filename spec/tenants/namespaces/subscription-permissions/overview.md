# Overview

In this section you will learn all about **subscription permissions** and how to interact with them in our app.


## The subscription permissions data structure. 

Subscription permissions are used to assign roles to user groups. The **subscription** name is considered a **key**, and **must be unique**. Being the key, the **subscription name can't be modified** after the permission is created. Permissions are set separately for each namespace.

## Opening the subscription permissions settings page

3. Press on button **Subscription permissions**, to open subscription permissions settings.
